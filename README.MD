# PunchMeIn :punch:

A command line script that tells you when you can clock out to meet your hours.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6+

## Running the Script

1. Open your CLI of choice and navigate to the folder where you've saved punch.py.
2. Type `python punch.py` and press `ENTER`
3. Follow the prompts for user input

## Tips

- Type `exit` at any of the user prompts to exit the script
- Use military (or 24hr) time
- Version 0.1 rounds to the nearest quarter hour when clocking in and out.
  * Entering a clock in time of 0738hrs will show up as 0745
  * Entering a clock in time of 0907hrs will show up as 0900

## Future Plans

#### Short Term

- Option to choose whether time is rounded or not
- Option to use 12hr formatting

#### Mid Term

- Feature: Enter hours worked so far this pay period and number of shifts left to get number of hours needed each day to make goal

#### Long Term

- Web app???
